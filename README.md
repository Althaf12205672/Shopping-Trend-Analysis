# Shopping Trend Analysis 📊  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of shopping trends** to understand customer behavior, purchasing preferences, and the influence of factors such as **seasonality, demographics, and discounts**.

The analysis aims to generate **actionable insights** that can help businesses improve **marketing strategies, inventory planning, and customer targeting**.

This project was completed as an **academic EDA project** using Python and data visualization techniques. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data but often lack insights into:
- Seasonal buying patterns  
- Demographic purchasing behavior  
- Effectiveness of discounts and promotions  

This project explores these aspects through structured EDA.

## 🔍 Methodology
The analysis followed a structured EDA pipeline:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Checked missing values and duplicates
   - Standardized data formats
2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Age distribution
   - Gender distribution
   - Purchase amount analysis
3. **Categorical Analysis**
   - Item purchased
   - Product category
   - Payment methods
4. **Seasonal & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Sales trends across seasons
   - Category-wise seasonal demand
   - Gender vs purchase amount
5. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and grouped bar charts

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Clothing** is the most purchased category
- **Male customers** contribute higher total purchase value
- Purchases are **almost evenly distributed across seasons**
- **Discounts significantly increase purchase activity**
- Certain product categories show **season-specific demand spikes**

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Age distribution histogram with density curve  
- Gender-wise purchase distribution  
- Category-wise and season-wise purchase analysis  
- Grouped bar charts for seasonal category trends  

(All visualizations are available in the notebook and report.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
